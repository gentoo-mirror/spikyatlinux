www-client/ungoogled-chromium:cfi - Build with CFI (Control Flow Integrity) enabled (recommended).
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:clang - Use Clang compiler instead of GCC
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:closure-compile - Enable closure type-checking for Chrome's web technology-based UI. Requires Java and bundled binary compiler.jar in sources tree
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:convert-dict - Patch and build the convert_dict utility. The script will be installed into /usr/lib64/chromium-browser/ungoogled-chromium-update-dicts.sh More info here: https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/issues/188#issuecomment-444752907
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:disable-perfetto - Disable dependencies on third_party/perfetto
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:disable-tracing - Disable tracing (chrome://tracing/)
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:enable-driver - Build chromedriver
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:gnome - Improve integration with GIO (libgio).
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:gold - Use GNU's gold linker.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:hangouts - Enable support for Google Hangouts features such as screen sharing
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:jumbo-build - Coalesce translation units together, making builds faster on single machines, at the expense of more memory during build time. This flag is not automatically tested by Chromium developers, so it may not work all the time.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:libcxx - Build against sys-devel/libcxx, which requires that all C++ dependencies must be built with '-stdlib=libc++' (EXPERIMENTAL).
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:lld - LLD is a linker from the LLVM project. That is a drop-in replacement for system linkers and runs much faster than them (recommended).
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:new-tcmalloc - Use the soon-to-be default tcmalloc.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:optimize-thinlto - Whether to enable ThinLTO optimizations. Turning ThinLTO optimizations on can substantially increase link time and binary size, but they generally also make binaries a fair bit faster.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:optimize-webui - Optimize parts of Chromium's UI written with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) for runtime performance purposes. This does more work at compile time for speed benefits at runtime.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:pdf - Enable the built-in PDF viewer
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:proprietary-codecs - Enable proprietary codecs like H.264, MP3.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:suid - Build the SUID sandbox, which is only needed on CONFIG_USER_NS=n kernels.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-ffmpeg - Use the system media-video/ffmpeg instead of bundled.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-harfbuzz - Use the system media-libs/harfbuzz instead of bundled.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-icu - Use the system dev-libs/icu instead of bundled.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-jsoncpp - Use the system dev-libs/jsoncpp instead of bundled.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-libevent - Use the system dev-libs/libevent instead of bundled.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-libvpx - Use the system media-libs/libvpx instead of bundled.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-openh264 - Use the system media-libs/openh264 instead of bundled. If disabled, it will restrict USE=bindist.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:system-openjpeg - Use the system-wide media-libs/openjpeg instead of bundled. OpenJPEG use are exclusively for Chromium's PDF viewer.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:tcmalloc - Use bundled tcmalloc instead of system malloc.
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:thinlto - Build with ThinLTO support. LTO (Link Time Optimization) achieves better runtime performance through whole-program analysis and cross-module optimization (highly recommended).
www-client/ungoogled-chromium:widevine - Unsupported closed-source DRM capability (required by Netflix VOD).
